It is known to have committed severe human rights breach, albeit in the Congo and not the Amazon. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/wwf-report-human-rights-abuses-rangers  But then again, you're also directing funding to the Singapore franchise which is highly unlikely to have projects in S. America...  Humans rights violations particular targeted at indigenous peoples are important because they are the best defence against deforestation. Supporting indigenous people in their pursuit to obtain land rights and defend against external economic extractive motives is one of the best ways of protecting the world's remaining rainforests Other organisations that you could show support for include Survival International https://survivalinternational.org/ or Amazon Watch https://amazonwatch.org/",2371423576506482,,

I think people who are lost in the end of their financial goal are people who aren’t sure of their self-purpose on the first place. Their lack of self conciousness.

2381147788867394,Adonis Lee Villamor,"Nice POV but misses on several reality. Time and Money to me are basically currencies. you can exchange one for the other for a limited period. The more successful people always exchange one for the other with greater yield.  You buy money with time whenever you work on a business, profession, employment, etc. Time you spent has an exchange rate for money which you set with your counterparts.   Now for buying time with money, whenever you buy shortcuts in life, you use money. Riding a bike is cheaper than riding a boat. riding a boat is cheaper than riding a plane. You think you are smart being a cheapskate but what you lost is another tick of your time choosing to ride a bicycle. Also in business, a person given millions in capital will always have an edge over someone who starts everything from zero.  A great example of utilization of time and money in unison is debt leveraging. It is a gamble by locking yourself into huge debts with MONEY you do not have which you believe you can generate in the future TIME. this is double edged though as it can send one to ruins if you abuse it.  Time and money are the most important thing because they can bring success or misery in ones life. they are the most constant to manage and everything else is plain random.",2381545245494315,,
2381147788867394,Yevgeny  Blinov,"I so much disagree with that.  I think the idea that, - ""If you're rich you don't know whether your friends are true"", - is wrong. It comes from the old bogus that ""money is the root of all evil""...  Do poor people know for sure their friends are true?  Do poor people have enough time for their family? Don't poor people think about money on daily basis? Don't poor people worry about losing what they have? Are poor people surrounded by honest people? Are poor people happy?  Can't poor people suffer from depressions? Can't poor get robbed?  The reality is that the ""Rich people problems"" are in fact everyone's problems. We should stop demonizing material wealth.",394658011445426,,

With “too much” money you can almost anything the world can offer. Even time, figuratively, while people have to wait in line for the next flight...buy your own jet and takes off.  And even love, at the point that you have “too much” money, you don’t need to care about the process of making impressions, you don’t need to go great lengths to achieve something, at that point you can offer your partner anything they needed. Afraid of your partner not loving you and only your money? Well they need you and not the opposite, you can dump them anytime you want and keep finding. After all, isn’t that the process of finding love? Keep picking until you picked the right person, the difference is this time, you can choose anyone from anywhere.  Friendship at that point is very difficult to earn but not impossible, with that much wealth you can literally build your own society and befriend with people of your standards.  You’ll have the best food in the world, best medical treatment humanity can offer, best experience of any kind, best use of time. Yes even happiness if you know what makes you happy. Nothing that belongs to human will be out of your reach as long as you have “too much” money.",2381342528847920,,

There is absolutely nothing wrong with a parent passing down some sort if inheritance to a child and ultimately it is up to that child to do with that inheritance as they please.  A balance in life can be found. I see myself as someone who is very good with money, yet I still find time to have fun and have hobbies.

Anyway, just want to highlight that not all loans are equal and shouldn’t always be seen as a bad thing. Yours is an education loan, which is akin to borrowing time to repay money in exchange for learning skills and potentially higher pay, which is a positive trade-off in and of itself. That you picked up financial literacy lessons makes it another win for you too! As opposed to say credit card loan, which is often a negative trade-off if for example, it is an impulse purchase with little benefits. A bit simplistic, but you get the drift. 🙂",2310339975948176,,

This illusion is dangerous.

However, when you mentioned you need to work to get the money to buy yourself the things that you wanted, like fulfilling your dream, have you realized that some may be miserable while working for so long to achieve their dream ? Not all of us have the luxury to do something we love and make it our source of income at the same time.  Isn't it ironic? People sacrificing their happiness to obtain happiness?

But doing it just to save money/show off how much money you saved on your holiday is not a good reason to go.  You also need to account for the sheer amount of mental and physical energy for preparation, training, planning and mapping, the possibility that your bike might get lost on the flight/that you might get lost on the road/that it might rain/hail the whole time/that you might get injured/ and money spent on equipment/tents/ waterproofing/panniers/ insurance/a decent bicycle.   I would do it more often but i also like travelling with friends who don't have 4+ weeks of leave ever year/ who can't cycle/have chronic illnesses/back issues/joint issues/disabilities that prevent them from camping/cycling for 6h a day. I have considered doing it solo but I also enjoy not worrying about being assaulted/being nagged by my family that I will definitely get attacked while camping alone in remote areas.  But, if you enjoy planning, cycling long distances, seeing amazing sights, being entirely self sufficient and camping it can really be the best way to travel and this is a good place to start:   https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/",2414002482248591,,

That being said, generally, majority of diploma/degree holders should not consider this option full time, as their career runway and lifetime earnings should be higher. You lose out significantly on work experiences (and CPF) and makes you harder to hire the longer you are not in your industry, compared to peers of your age. Making a jump when your age bracket of your peers exceeding your income is nigh impossible.  Also, once these ride hailing firms move to profitability,  we would expect a very significant drop in incentives (markets can't stay irrational forever).  In addition, huge R&D is done in the self driving space as the skills required is a very low barrier to entry.

For some driving Grab, regardless of age, could be their ""career"" as one just need time flexibility - maybe after some years of work experiences, prefers to drive Grab as compared to a corporate world. That is one's personal preference.   It may also be a young person pursuing media and animation, therefore prefers to work on ad-hoc projects to gain some knowledge while driving Grab for basic needs. That may be exploration of a possible career option of being a Web Designer for example. Thats not delusional. Its just part of one's career planning process.    There are also factors that will influence such decisions such as external commitment that renders a young person to drive Grab too.  Therefore, to use monetary benefits and talk about career, to define something about a young person driving Grab may need further investigation. Different folks look at things differently within a career pathway.  Of course, if a young individual thinks that driving Grab is financially sustainable AND doesnt possess sufficient skills which the workforce demands - then one has to relook on his/her career objectives - and ask questions like ""what does it take to reach there"" - most likely being Grab driver not possible.

2351939931788180,Clement Low,"Agree totally. I had this conversation with a friend. You missed a point though.  See, Let's say being a grab driver, working for equivalent hours gets you 40k at 20YO without needing a degree. It's a lot easier to get into, you can rent rather than buy a car to do this, and you can get a decent, stable income, slightly higher than fresh grad entry salary.  The trouble with grab (on top of the fact that autonomous transport is coming, and threatens to wipe taxi-type services out), is that while working in grab, you gain no real experience. I mean, other than being a very good driver, and a particularly good navigator. Most of the entrepreneurship-related tasks are handled by the grab app itself.  It's not like there's even anything particularly value-added you could do to add value to your service. Once I'm done with a grab ride, even if the fella is really polite, drives really safely and gently, and the whole deal is a super comfy experience, I can hardly even be bothered to rate his services. There's really near zero ways you can do anything that takes any particular kind of passion mixed with ingenuity, anything that future bosses might be interested in.  Which means once he's done being a grab driver and wants to do some work in another industry, whatever he did for grab is completely inapplicable. It doesn't even count as job exp.  So, fine even if earning 4k in your 40s isn't entirely a bad thing (say you're single, or you don't have kids, and maybe you were savvy enough to invest, it's not _entirely_ bad), the fact will still remain that your future earnings potential is severely limited, when pretty much _any_ other job could have gotten you some kind of job exp that future employers would care about.  That said though, if you're some poor uni/poly student, grab is an incredibly good way to bolster your income, pay for school fees and whatnot. Again, if the income is wisely spent or invested at that age, on top of working towards an actual real job at the end of it all, you can support yourself easily as a student.",2360684667580373,,

I've made this PSA and have posted it several times (I'll post it every 6 months maybe) and it has helped educate my audience/readers/online passer-bys of my page. It has helped my page immensely and now, this happens to me mucccch less. It is true that some people who do this don't give a damn (and that's truly a shame) but, most people actually don't know that there is an etiquette when it comes to this. Also, I have learned that a lot of people don't tend to read a body of text and would pay more attention to imagery. That's why I chose to make this PSA in this format. I hope that those people will choose to be more responsible with your content in the future too! All the best. Love your work!",2372275993087907,,

I translate your panels (with the original text still there) in order to spread the woke and knowledge. I'm a translator myself too so I think my translation is quite delivering enough   So what's your thoughts on my case? I'd like to support you without hurting you.

No matter who grab and post your work will automatically give credit to you cause its your character who is there. If the content is what people are translating, it would be hard to go each and everyone cause they can say that its their own idea as well. But if the main idea and focus of your intentions as an advocate is for people to be educated like you being a woke salary man, i think let the good deed you imparted do the job to bring you sponsors and people to help you grow your network. I hope you will not stop sharing the wisdom you have for people who wants to be awaken here in social media. God bless and more power to your page ❤️❤️❤️",2372305986418241,,

Apply for copyright or trademark... or create watermark in every drawing ✍️ v tedious, but very useful. But people will still copy in this century!

2404744283174411,The Woke Salaryman,"A disclaimer:   This comic is about how WE choose to invest. It’s not the be all and end all. There are other ways to invest, but this is the one we feel most comfortable with. (We feel like we gotta say this upfront, because investing is like a cult to some people – challenge their world-views and they go bonkers).   It won’t help you get rich quick overnight, but we believe it’s a pretty efficient way to go about doing things – and a much better alternative to just sitting on your butt without doing anything.   This comic also had to take some liberties when explaining analogies. There are space limitations when you create a 40-panel comic about investing, but we have tried – as much as possible – to create a piece of content that’s both entertaining and informative.   Finally, we think it’s important that before you have invest… you…  1) Pay off all your high interest debt (above 3%) 2) Have at least six months of living expenses (I’d go up to a year) 3) Have to understand that you might lose money and that this is a long term play (more than 10 years) 4) Get covered with proper health insurance   ^ If you’re not any of the above, please don’t invest your money. You need to save first.   For those who like reading, we’ve have an article about how we invest here:   https://thewokesalaryman.com/the-woke-salaryman-way-of-investing/  Further reading: https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/07/13/what-most-20-somethings-dont-get-about-investing/",2404746286507544,,

For Stage 1: STI-ETF (Hill of Passive Investing)  If you're investing $100 per month, I think DBS Invest Saver gives the best rates. For amounts above $500 per month, consider OCBC or POEMS.   (I've found out the best way to get started on this is actually taking a day off, going down to a local branch in person and talk to a real person. Show them this comic and say you wanna do Stage 1. Any competent staff will be able to help you. )  For Stage 2: Global ETFs (Rock of Double Diversification)   Popular platforms to buy global ETFs in Singapore include Standard Charted (go get an account), Interactive Brokers and FundSuperMart.   Buying ETFs based on the London Stock Exchange is your best option because there's less tax (you can google it yourself, too long to explain in this comic)  To make a sweeping statement, if you're buying very frequently, it makes sense not to go with IB or FSM. Otherwise, all options are okay, as long as you spend at least $5,000 per transaction.

Many of the steady defensives eg REITs are dependent on rental-yield-growth (ie, squeezing businesses in malls). I find that ethically challenging for me.   The best way is to take part in a high growth business as an equity owner or investor.   Stock market is not always going to go up. The naive go all in. The prudent hold cash and await opportunities.   Active investing is hit or miss.

We shouldn't plan for our children to support us but family helps family.  When my adult son lost his job and his home he and his family moved in but being the very independent person we raised him to be he didn't want to be there and with 3000dollars that we loaned him, built a business that has led to his financial success and stability.  We didn't do it, he did but we were there when he needed us. You may say that it was our obligation but, once a child is old enough to make their own decisions, good and bad, ends the parents obligation. After that it's love.

We hear so many times these statements: poor people should stop their bad habits and start saving; poor people should make better decisions to break out; poor people should stop having kids etc. if you have read poverty research, we know that we cannot pin blame on this economic demographic, because their circumstances warrant them to act this way, which is why the poverty cycle is a real thing.

BCOS the parents will foot the bill.  If they have to foot the bill, they will not ask their parents along.  Most parents are doing better then their highly educated children due to lower cost back then but new parents in this generation is facing high cost and tt explains the article below  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/number-of-babies-born-here-drops-to-8-year-low?utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=STFB&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR1FybMmpAE4kA5J_7-850mOsNMhOMDAmF4aoWIYfGlqf-bmuLWWlUWNQDE#Echobox=1563751629  Also the high jobless rate or poor quality job tt comes with work life balance does not allow new parents to have big family and in a way one becomes more then enough.  Tt also lead to one grown up children have to struggle w his/her own family and back to taking care of parents.  The equation is already not balance.

2345014375814069,Inex Yip,"k long comment ahead, which I wrote in response.   So many ways to look at it, and having kids is a complicated issue in itself. It is almost gospel truth what was outline here in your sketches, but a bigger truth is, we still need children.  If not to look after ourselves in old age, society as a whole need people to function, unless we have advanced to the stage where robots can do everything, including elderly care, in which we faced a future where humans slowly extinct ourselves.  Say we are not that smart and robotics and AI could not develop at a pace where they can replace humans, we potentially faced an aging population where without younger people (nurses, doctors and etc) to ensure the elderly's basic needs are met- not even enough foodpanda delivery people to deliver food when you have difficulty walking, i can only say good luck to all of us.  The idea of slowly starving to death or falling down with no one knowing you are in deep shit is so real. I say this because my own mum took a fall last week and fractured her hand. Lucky for us it was not serious, but being the ever optimist (hurhur), it could have been.  Had she no kids, few would care how she fare after that. Of course the bigger tragedy would have been she had kids and none of them give a shit. But I like to think she brought up us right and it would be an understatement to say we care a lot what happen to her.  No one knew what is going to happen in the future. Even the best laid plans go a wary. Say your retirement funds are great, you have no financial worries but what crap, you had a stroke/dementia that basically effects your basic functions and decision making abilities, who is going to look after you and make decisions that are in your best interests? Folks, this shit is so very real and not that far down the road for some of us.  If you ask me, having kids is not foolproof with no guaranteed returns and expectations yes, hey but having a plan is better than having no plan. While it is all rainbows and butterflies that you want to raise kids with zero expectations, then as someone sharing the same airspace, I beseech you to raise not a brat but at least a contributing, law abiding member of society, which in my opinion is good enough.  But of course if at the end of the day your kid still do not wish to take care of you for whatever reasons, maybe you have to ask yourself what went wrong in your parenting. As a Chinese, I believe in filial piety. I don't know what you believe in but if you believe right now you have some form of responsibility towards your own parents, what is stopping you from passing on that value?",2346948465620660,,

2345014375814069,Muhammad Faisal Muaz,"This is not all true. Im a father and do not want money from my children when they grew up. In Islam, the parents have the responsibility to raise the kids and vice versa, they still have the responsibility of taking care their parents. Believe me, when u are getting old, u want nothing except for ur kids to come and visit u from time to time.",2346792128969627,,
2345014375814069,Michael Plaisted,"This kind of position can only be had in a socialist society. In a free society, parents raise their children and then children 'honor their father and mother so that their days may be long on the land'. This is because free societies demand strong families. Children take care of their parents because they love them and see setting an example of how their children are to take care of them when they are old too.  In a socialist society, the elderly are taken care of by their children by force through taxation and social security benefits. And not just their children but the rest of society. You can pick only one of these two options.  '“Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.”  Children should remain in the equity of their parents instead of being adopted by rulers through legal citizenship which breaks up the family and installs human Benefactors as equitable “fathers” and demotes parents as “legal guardians“. Through birth certification, human civil governments assume equitable rights to the education, discipline, healthcare, welfare, and best interests of the child. In exchange, parents receive tax write-offs, and the assurance that their biological offspring will be taken care of by the collective through taxation and bureaucracy. In this way, parents dishonor their children. The honor prescribed by this commandment is a double-edged sword. Children should also take care of their parents in their old age and not rely on the social security of socialist benefactors which makes their neighbor liable for them through covetousness and sloth. Christ called this ‘the Corban that makes the word of God to none effect.’ Children should assume personal responsibility to care for the elderly of society and not rely on the man-made institutions that appear to be fine establishments but change the nature of society by giving it hard hearts as those personal responsibilities are outsourced, again, to the collective. When children effectively honor their parents, the political party of the family thrives, and the equity and allodium of the family taking dominion over the earth remains in the family instead of being broken up by authoritative institutions that weaken the family. In this way, free societies demand strong families, which enable for “thy days to remain long upon the land.”  Pursuant to the parens patriae doctrine, “the primary control and custody of infants is with the government…” (Ex parte Wright, 225 Ala. 220)'  https://abolishhumanarchism.com/2018/11/04/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-heaven/",2347970775518429,,

But here we have so many diverse and biased opinions about what is good to do on many life aspects.  Islam came when it was a common fear among the people that they can not afford to share their meals with their children so they let the children die or killed them. Islam denies that fear, and tells us that God will provide the living of all His creature with His mercy.  But now, the so-called modern society gets back into the similar fear. However, it is now not the fear by the parents, but the fear by the childrens who are afraid that they will not be able to afford to share their meals with their elderly parents.

It is stupid, if you don't wanna come don't come lah, you ask people come to wedding like ah long ask for his money back, what the hell.",2316047125377461,,

But 9 out of 10 wedding I have attended, I have heard that one of the couple, mostly the groom, will still have to do some supervision of the event flow here and there during the wedding. Kind of tedious, isn't it?  And for those young couple, who just step into society, and really not much $$ in your pocket, really do consider not spending so much on wedding or just do away with it in exchange for something else that's smaller in scale and that could be more intimate. Psst, not everyone will give the market rate for ang bao when they attend the banquet. Don't be a dumbass and assume that you can recover your losses through the banquet.

2391879244460915,Clement Low,"well, the irony is this. CPF actually 'hurts' the richest - After all, it's 20% of their salary they couldn't have otherwise reallocated to more profitable ventures. Whether it's their own business (which could have an ROI of a few multiples) or some kind of investment.  But the people who seem to be complaining the loudest are people who are coming from the bottom of the income bracket - the very people CPF _really_ benefits. I mean after all, many or even most of them don't actually have the social resources or financial skills to invest and manage their finances. a 4% PA interest rate is far more than most would get by chucking it into a FD. Most would simply gamble it away in some game of chance, and maybe a few might be wise and/or educated enough to put it in the right places to grow more than 4% PA. But they'll be the undoubted exception rather than the norm.  It doesn't help that certain members of the opposition, or some pro-opp vigilantes (I'm looking at you, Roy Ngerng) fuel all that frustration by essentially spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories that the Govt is basically taking CPF. or worse, in RN's case, outright accusing PM Lee for personally pocketing CPF.  I think the most understated point made is the fact that we don't pay the kind of exorbitant taxes that other 'free' and 'first-world countries' pay - taxes which go directly into supporting the previous generation into retirement. CPF comes back to you eventually with interest. You might pay taxes today to support the people of yesterday, but the people of tomorrow pay increased amounts and struggle with the strain to pay the taxes of tomorrow to support you. Even if it benefits you in the here and now, your sons and daughters will directly feel the strain. It's not as if your medical bills when you're old will be cheaper than they are today.  Are there still problems? Sure there are. There are some families who can't make ends meet because part of their pay goes to CPF. But the fact will still remain that the money still comes back to them at a later age - money they'll still need to survive anyway.",2405186786463494,,

In total the company “give you 37% free money in your CPF.” I have to explain to her the 20% is from our pay check and company only give 17%. Now she agree, CPF suck 😂.",2392587251056781,,

2323000471348793,Nicholas Le Hugger,"Sharing the 3 lessons that I learnt when I'm 30 years old, and I'm glad that its not too late. (35yrs old now)  1) Make it a habit to save your money in the Stock Market (US Market for me), and not in the Bank because its not the Banker's interest to protect the value of your capital.  2) Investing isn't rocket science, and you don't really need to know all the financial numbers to find a good product/company to investment. All you really really need, is a short term money plan (how much to save, how much to invest, etc), a mid term learning objective, and a long term financial goal (how much you want to achieve). And MOST IMPORTANT, an understanding of your risk appetite.  3) Time is far more valuable than money. Don't trade off all your precious time to earn something that will deprecate.",2323020801346760,,
2323000471348793,Anna Burgess,"Don't count on inheriting wealth or marrying well. Ex: I knew girls in college who spent all their money going to clubs/sporting events etc in hopes of meeting Mr. Right.  They joked about going to college to earn a Mrs instead of maximizing what they could have learned for a future career.  Don't invest in specific companies. Invest in a general index fund with low fees, add every month and leave it alone.  General index funds will improve or fail on the economy as a whole and single person mismanaging a company will not cause you to lose your investments. There's a reason why most funds are pegged (compared)  against index funds.   Aim for a growth mix if you're young and can tolerate risk in your portfolio (mix of general index funds, emerging market funds, high yield dividend funds) and move to more stable investments in the future (index funds / government bonds and treasuries)  If you have saved enough of a nest egg, consider real estate but first! understand what drives real estate value (location/ accessibility to jobs, location/accessibility to transit options, location/ accessibility to services and entertainment options). People think it's because something is ""trending/popular"" that drives RE sales pricing but it's really those three factors. During the depths of the RE market crash (US) I convinced my husband to buy based on those factors and did well.  Learn to leverage money properly (see above). There are people who will tell you not to go into debt, and if this is for frivolous things like fancy cars etc. then yes it makes sense. However if it is to take advantage of a business opportunity, or because the cost of borrowing is low compared to the guaranteed ROI (bond notes, CDs, etc.) then do that. Ex: if i can buy something I need for 0% interest financing, then I get that thing and put the rest of my money in a CD or similar investment vehicle that can return guaranteed interest.",2347309095584597,,

But the government only pay him $200/mnth. So even if you saved 1 million in your CPF, you will only get $1K/mnth. He also told about many ppl especially guys who had no children died and their entire estate, many few hundreds thousands went to the government. The point is if you want a good retirement, vote to change the economic and social situation in Sg. No matter how much tou saved in the current economic and social situation, you will still have to work beyond retirement age. Also how many can actually live to 65.",2301823750133132,,
