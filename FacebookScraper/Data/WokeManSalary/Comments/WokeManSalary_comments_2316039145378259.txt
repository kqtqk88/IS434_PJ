The Woke Salaryman,Why we think you should spend less money on your wedding today? Because this money could be used to build your future. Money is your twenties is super duper precious.

Shermon Ong,"If it was up to my wife and I, we would've definitely done away with the banquet.  However, there's something called ""parents"", and more often than not, the wedding is for them to invite their relatives and friends as a gathering. Some may say it is YOUR wedding, not YOUR PARENTS' one, but cmon, it's easier said than done. Sometimes if spending that extra $30k can prevent a strained and hostile start to your marriage, then maybe it's worth it. After all, our parents don't have many kids to start with and they don't fall within the category of ""irresponsible parents"".  Of course I recognise that every couple's circumstance is unique, so these are just my $0.02's worth. Peace!",Jun/13/19 13,2316057632043077,,

Does it taste better than hawker centre? NO!   2. Gate crash is dumb. I wanna ask, when they gate crash can I sleep through it? 😴😴😴😴 It’s too early for these shit.  3. If I get to chose, I rather just sign the paper and have none of these. So much work, so much time and energy wasted. Sighhhhh.   But wedding isn’t about ME.

Nadia Elias,"There's also the culture of ""forcing"" people to come to a wedding, onion auntie like to say ""If you don't come to my daughters wedding, we won't come to your wedding/nobody will want to come to your wedding!"". So young people become afraid and reluctantly go to far away 2-day trip wedding, spending money on gas and hotel. Yet stay at the wedding for what, 4 hours? It is stupid, if you don't wanna come don't come lah, you ask people come to wedding like ah long ask for his money back, what the hell.",Jun/13/19 13,2316047125377461,,

Nana Ko,"not entirely true. most restaurant have a minimum spending for u to book their entire restaurant space to hold ur intimate weddings.   if u want to hit the minimum spending they provide, u ll need to invite more ppl which defeats the entire purpose of ur small wedding. it ll still be a space filling wedding.   if u dont do that, u bear the cost of ur guest giving ""below $150 angbao"" when per pax is supposed to be $250++ instead. theres no win-win in every situation.",Jun/14/19 14,2316390412009799,,

CheeHao Lee,"It really depends on the financial situation of the couple. If you are well to do- GO AHEAD to create whatever fantasy wedding you want. But 9 out of 10 wedding I have attended, I have heard that one of the couple, mostly the groom, will still have to do some supervision of the event flow here and there during the wedding. Kind of tedious, isn't it?  And for those young couple, who just step into society, and really not much $$ in your pocket, really do consider not spending so much on wedding or just do away with it in exchange for something else that's smaller in scale and that could be more intimate. Psst, not everyone will give the market rate for ang bao when they attend the banquet. Don't be a dumbass and assume that you can recover your losses through the banquet. You might even incur even greater losses. Haha.",Jun/16/19 16,2317989111849929,,
