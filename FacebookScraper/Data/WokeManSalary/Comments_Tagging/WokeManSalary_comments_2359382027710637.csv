So he bought the car I want in cash, and I buy that car from him on a 3-year lease 😄  So he got his money back plus interest which is much more than just having it Deposit at the Bank, and at the end of the lease I spent less on the car I want.

Ares Escudero,,"This actually depends on financial literacy that will be learned by the children either thru the parents, work, or school.  Let's say for example, the same guy inherited money from his dad, but at the same time taught him financial literacy and reinforced it thru schooling and then work, that same guy would've still invested the money, still put in the work, but this time since there's an advantage from the inheritance he might've enjoyed some of the things he missed (like in the picture, missed relationships, experiences, and many things) on a younger age, because we cannot buy time even if we put in all the work.  Which also means, in a fast moving world, from the picture the dad might've put the child in a disadvantage of having to start from scratch vs. his peers just because he didn't open up financial literacy with him on a young age.",Oct/28/19 28,514497602721404

Shane Geiger,,"I feel the author of this comic is a bit misguided. Being financially competent and getting an inheritance are not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of people out there who get ""inheritances"" from their parents and have the foresight to grow that wealth over time. Maybe his father saw that he was lazy and would squander away anything he was given and felt this was the kick in the ass he needed to learn some financial planning. Honestly, that's what this sounds like to me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a parent passing down some sort if inheritance to a child and ultimately it is up to that child to do with that inheritance as they please.  A balance in life can be found. I see myself as someone who is very good with money, yet I still find time to have fun and have hobbies. The author of this has sacrificed all of that for the pursuit of wealth. While that is certainly his prerogative, it is not mine. To me, everything in life should be a balance.
