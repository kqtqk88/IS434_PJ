Xen GK,"Another enlightening comic as always The Woke Salaryman, I share your comic with my young and old clients for education 👍  There is also another bright side, you didn't inherited any debts.

Belinda Tam,"Miro Yuuzuki tagging u for DBZ reference  But also then again the dad could have just been straightforward and go like ""I want you to learn independence"" sparing this poor child a childhood of anger 😅 nothing wrong with being transparent about the lessons you want to teach",9/Aug/19 Aug,2359385451043628

Mary Ellen Karp,That’s how I feel. No matter what we get for the house it’s an amazing gift from them. The goofy sentimental things are what I value.,18/Oct/19 Oct,484883155438497
Krisnata Panji,"my dad raised me to be independent too,  he didn't buy me cars, fancy phone and any other fancy stuff.   but he provided me with all basic needs so I can focus on learning, he paid for all my education till college, buy me phone and paid the bill, a computer, allowance, motorcycle for everyday transport, by all means, none of it are fancy, just a basic needs.  now i'm in mid 20, just left home last month, with my dream job and pursuing career in it, without parents financial support, even trying to ease their burden with paying for my brother college fees.  while it's important to make your kid independent, providing basic needs for them to be independent is also parents responsibility.  if you can't provide for them, don't make kids. kids are expensive.",13/Aug/19 Aug,471259150322805
Duane Matthew Hipwell,"So miss out on enjoying youth for the sakes of financial capital? Nonsense. I never asked for anything from my parents, and I've worked hard to get into a great position where I live very comfortably. However, when I have kids, I will allow them to enjoy my wealth AND teach them the value of effort and hard work. These are mutually exclusive. You can have one without the other, and you can have both.  It's all about raising children with an understanding and an appreciation of the value of money. You can still do this, even when rewarding them as such in this comic.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359618087687031
Hui Chyi Ch'ng,"But even if you dad really gave you house and car, it doesn't mean that you won't work hard to acheive financial independence. So, I only agree to this story to a certain extent.

I work hard myself and never depending on him, if he would give me any someday I just won't accept it. Coz in his age he is not suppose to work hard just so he can inherit something for us, his children.

Sean Li-wen Cheong,"If you work in the arts and media, then it's literally true for the kiddos.

イェン イン,"I think parents could have used another way of saying be financially independent instead of using harsh words that make the child bitter, lost all the time of building meaningful friendship, relationships, the mind became so obsessed with money, wasted so many years of being sad and traumatized by such harsh words is not worth it. The word used is just not wise in my opinion.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359891790992994
Raymicle Chin,Great and wonderful comic that is full of inspiration! This is a right guidance to our young generation. Extremely Helpful.,11/Aug/19 Aug,477326966391434
Colleen Hector,I get the message but idk something about this just doesn’t sit right with me I understand working hard and sacrifice. I come from a poor family so if I have the means to make my child’s life easier I will while still teaching them the importance of hard work and sacrifice. I especially didn’t like that u spent most of your childhood angry at your dad when I think about all the missed moments it breaks my heart. But I get it different time and generation just hope you do things differently with your kids if you have them.,13/Aug/19 Aug,222720462038655
Pachig Santos,"While thats nice. Where will ur dads money go? Charity? Donations? For what its worth dont we work hard for our families so they can enjoy the fruits of our labor. Yes it sacrifices the mindset of being financially sound and independent. But isnt there a fine line between relying on and using as an advantage? Coz the reality of things. In the end, where will ur dad's money go if u get nothing?",13/Aug/19 Aug,471244980324222
Kyle Tan Raymond,Instead of giving tough love. His father should explain properly to his son.  Father : I will inherit my money and property to you once u proof  to me that u are capable of financially handling yourself,10/Aug/19 Aug,2360048300977343
Faizal Nur Ajiz,"I mean, I get the frugal and over achiever mentality. But saying ""you will inherit nothing"" and then do nothing to nurture the child mind is bad parenting in my book. Kids and teens are easily influenced, and what if that hate diverts into something negative, all because the father refuse to do anything other than saying he won't give the inheritance.",9/Aug/19 Aug,2359483821033791
Jp Lim,"You should be so lucky to only have yourself to worry about.  In the Philippines where I come from, it’s customary for the kids (especially eldest kids like me) to support the parents and younger siblings once they reach working age. 😔",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359828824332624
Patrick Milan,"I disagree. Sometimes the harsh words can bring down someone else’s confidence that can lead to anxiety and depression. And sadly, it can be passed to the next generation. Love your family, make your kids financially educated and make them emotionally, physically, and spiritually rich. That will lead to a truly rich person.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359919144323592
Amandaz Ng,"You forgot the other side of the coin: inherit nothing so you earn all that is yours, BUT you still need to give them money to show filial piety.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359555347693305
Joseph Cabz,At least show in this comic series that his dad assist and help him achieve his dream. All his dad says was inherit nothing. Sometimes those words can cause depression and anxieties to your kids. Not all people become successful regardless of the hardwork they did. A good parent would show an example on how things done. So for me he's not a good fucking father at all!,11/Aug/19 Aug,2360330534282453

Harper Zheng,"It really depends on the initial capacity and potential of the child.  If the child is useless, it’s better to let them see their uselessness and avoid mistakes. And not have a false sense of understanding that their parents monies is their ability. If the child is useful then the parents money can be a turbo boost to help them start business. Or study in very expensive but also useful schools.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359544977694342
Survivor Seeker,That's the wrong attitude of each child of a parent to tell to parents. Because parents does not hold the destiny and cannot control what the child wants in life to have.,14/Oct/19 Oct,513997989393092

Ivan Ali Raja,But how we can get happy at old age when even we got alot of money yet our vigor has literaly dissapeared and worse all the earned money diverge to old age disease treament and once we died our children will face the same dilemma of fighting over inheritance Could there be some alternative of atleast overcoming this?,9/Aug/19 Aug,2359438644371642
Melinda Leonie,"On another note: In Asia, most parents not only telling their children that the kids would inherit nothing, but the children would also need to take care of their parents when the parents are old. They raise you up, so you are forever indebted to them. So you are lucky if you are set free after you are independent, unlike some people who have to financially support their parents.",17/Aug/19 Aug,711662805947368
Chester Zapanta,"And in your pursuit of being financially independent, sacrificing your younger years with overwork, you grow up to be a bitter single middle aged person without anything to look back on and with not a single emotional investment on yourself... being financially stable is good.

Nelson Ngu,"The part that says “great fortunes, don’t last three generations” don’t apply to current society anymore. The rich family will only continue generations after generations and get even more money. With money, with power. With money, with followers.

Anton Tanzil,"When I want to lease my first car using my own money, my Dad sat me down and gave me the numbers of how much money I will spend in the end, of course being a 20 something I insist that I can afford that.  A few days later he said: ‘I have a solution, you can pay a lower interest and monthly payment by leasing the car to me’. So he bought the car I want in cash, and I buy that car from him on a 3-year lease 😄  So he got his money back plus interest which is much more than just having it Deposit at the Bank, and at the end of the lease I spent less on the car I want.  I still can’t believe he took advantage of that situation LOL.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359893997659440

Cat Bread,"Hah, a parent that is stingy to give money to their child, would be kind enough to donate the money for charity? They just want to keep the money for themselves, doing charity is just an excuse. Parenting really makes hypocrisy into another level.",9/Aug/19 Aug,2359448081037365
Christian Immanuel,"Actually it's similar to what my dad said. Same message but softer. ""Don't hope for inheritance. Strive on your own. If you ever have any inheritance is an extra.""   It's better than having siblings fight over inheritance.",28/Aug/19 Aug,948604542152214
