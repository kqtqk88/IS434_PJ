Lester Oliveros,"Great content, but for the readers, never forget to challenge an idea. Here's my take on it.  1. Spend quality time with your loved ones. 2. Time is everything. 3. Being rich doesn't exactly mean you don't have time. Most of the time, it's the other way around.",9/Sep/19 Sep,2382498708732302

Hui Chyi Ch'ng,"This is how we poor people comfort ourselves, in thinking that rich people have this kinda problem.. In fact, rich people may hire people to manage their business and their time are more flexible. While for poor people, have to work day and night, earn peanut. 😐 More problems caused by no money and also no time 😐. At least rich people have money.",7/Sep/19 Sep,2381217138860459
Yevgeny  Blinov,"I so much disagree with that.  I think the idea that, - ""If you're rich you don't know whether your friends are true"", - is wrong. It comes from the old bogus that ""money is the root of all evil""...  Do poor people know for sure their friends are true?  Do poor people have enough time for their family? Don't poor people think about money on daily basis? Don't poor people worry about losing what they have? Are poor people surrounded by honest people? Are poor people happy?  Can't poor people suffer from depressions? Can't poor get robbed?  The reality is that the ""Rich people problems"" are in fact everyone's problems. We should stop demonizing material wealth.",15/Oct/19 Oct,394658011445426

Cleve Wong,"The first silly post from Woke Salaryman though the drawings are good.  Broke ppl tend to console themselves that money can’t buy everything. The truth is that most of the time, people with money are happier and more content than those without.

Hamdani Bimarasa Wiratama,"This is not about rich or poor, but how you spend the time given to you. And always, regret comes later",9/Sep/19 Sep,2382807298701443
Adonis Lee Villamor,"Nice POV but misses on several reality. Time and Money to me are basically currencies. you can exchange one for the other for a limited period. The more successful people always exchange one for the other with greater yield.  You buy money with time whenever you work on a business, profession, employment, etc. Time you spent has an exchange rate for money which you set with your counterparts.   Now for buying time with money, whenever you buy shortcuts in life, you use money. Riding a bike is cheaper than riding a boat. riding a boat is cheaper than riding a plane. You think you are smart being a cheapskate but what you lost is another tick of your time choosing to ride a bicycle. Also in business, a person given millions in capital will always have an edge over someone who starts everything from zero.  A great example of utilization of time and money in unison is debt leveraging. It is a gamble by locking yourself into huge debts with MONEY you do not have which you believe you can generate in the future TIME. this is double edged though as it can send one to ruins if you abuse it.  Time and money are the most important thing because they can bring success or misery in ones life. they are the most constant to manage and everything else is plain random.",8/Sep/19 Sep,2381545245494315
Hendry Juwono,"The matter is he doesn't know how to manage his time correctly. Rich people have abundance of money so they might not be hesitate to hire capable employees to manage his business. With this set out, he can spend a lot of time with his family. Why working so hard for something that will make you regret later. Always be happy.",8/Sep/19 Sep,2381703692145137
Valentinus Victor Gunawan,"Okay... That's... Quite a jump on the last few frames, especially with the ox head and horse face...  Again, thanks for the slap.",7/Sep/19 Sep,2381167825532057
Trixie Kent,The fact is... Money CAN and CAN'T buy happiness.  It depends/varies to every individual and situation.  No need to argue whether it can or cannot.  Since each point of view will always be considered wrong or right by another individual.  But someone must just always remember  NOT TO LOVE MONEY MORE THAN THOSE THAT TRULY VALUE INTO YOUR LIFE.,20/Sep/19 Sep,116059953119724
Edmund Ngo,"This is really woke. It's a good reminder. Making a career change may not make sense to some ppl, esp when it involves lesser money. But its worth every single moment that you can spend with your family.",7/Sep/19 Sep,2381155022200004

Clement Goh,"I see some folks here complaining that this is a silly post and only the poor console themselves with this.

Reo Caligaran,"I made this simple ugly comic that gives positive impression to money after death. I am also a financial advocate, but I do believe on a higher purpose of money that it can still solve problem after death.   I think people who are lost in the end of their financial goal are people who aren’t sure of their self-purpose on the first place. Their lack of self conciousness.  Jack Ma is a perfect ultra rich man example who are self aware by quitting his multi-billion dollar company for his passion to teach and family.",8/Sep/19 Sep,2381728258809347
Ysa,"What about the people that have no reason to live in the first place? I know this is out of topic, but some people might think money isn’t everything. They could still focus on things that actually matter but not feel a thing. Just emptiness.",9/Sep/19 Sep,2382156288766544
Jun M. Y Do,"If he’s still busy working, he does not have “too much” money. If he can’t offer himself leisure, he does not have “too much” money.  With “too much” money you can almost anything the world can offer. Even time, figuratively, while people have to wait in line for the next flight...buy your own jet and takes off.  And even love, at the point that you have “too much” money, you don’t need to care about the process of making impressions, you don’t need to go great lengths to achieve something, at that point you can offer your partner anything they needed. Afraid of your partner not loving you and only your money? Well they need you and not the opposite, you can dump them anytime you want and keep finding. After all, isn’t that the process of finding love? Keep picking until you picked the right person, the difference is this time, you can choose anyone from anywhere.  Friendship at that point is very difficult to earn but not impossible, with that much wealth you can literally build your own society and befriend with people of your standards.  You’ll have the best food in the world, best medical treatment humanity can offer, best experience of any kind, best use of time. Yes even happiness if you know what makes you happy. Nothing that belongs to human will be out of your reach as long as you have “too much” money.",8/Sep/19 Sep,2381342528847920

He passed away a few years back due to a heart related issue. it happened once before the incident 2 years back before he died. He had a lot of stress managing his investments and work.

The self review will fix the problems of time, money, hobbies, and especially happiness. You ask yourself and the people around if the list is good and healthy to do, if not then you have to remove, change, and add better habits on the list. Do this in a year and you will have a lot of ""𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲"" spared for your happiness.
