63	Does using cash really make you spend less? Theoretically speaking, it doesn't. The use of cashless payment methods such as credit cards and bank apps actually helps people save money compared to using cash, with all things being equal. Whether it is through cashback you enjoy, discounts you receive or through higher interest because you kept your unused money in a savings account instead of your wallet. When you go one step deeper to think about this issue, you may realise that holding cash is counter intuitive towards building more savings. Imagine a hypothetical situation where everyone was paid his or her salary in cash, rather than for it to be deposited directly into your savings account. Will we really end up saving more, or be spending more instead? As we move towards a cashless nation, we must build technology that not only enables us to spend in a convenient manner, but to also save and invest easily. We imagine apps that notify kids to set aside money in their long-term designated savings account, and to receive some gifts like free vouchers to reward them for hitting savings goals. This makes saving money fun, rewarding and most importantly, convenient.	dnssingapore	2017-10-07 14:17:26+00:00	0	37	http://instagram.com/p/BZ77o9bHqBm/	dnssingapore	20171007T1417
64	The cost of healthcare and productivity losses stemming from obesity in Asia alone is roughly $226 billion. Half of the adults living with diabetes in the world also lives in Asia. The simple solution is to get people to start engaging in an active and healthy lifestyle from a young age. Working with AIA Vitality, youth coaches from English Premier League football team Tottenham Hotspurs go around certain Asian countries, including China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and others to get children to start playing football. Enjoying the game from a young age will mean they grow up playing regularly, and ultimately keeping an active lifestyle sweating it out with their friends. The best stay healthy and fit is to play a sport that you enjoy.	dnssingapore	2017-09-30 13:57:25+00:00	2	20	http://instagram.com/p/BZp3yN2nlCU/	dnssingapore	20170930T1357

67	In his National Day Rally speech, PM Lee highlighted the serious problem of diabetes in Singapore. Today, approximately one in nine Singaporeans have diabetes, with Singapore having the 2nd highest proportion of diabetics among developed nations. By 2050, it's estimated that there will be close to one million Singaporeans with Type 2 diabetes. To help address the healthcare needs of these people, AIA launched earlier this year the AIA Diabetes Care, a critical illness plan tailored specifically to pre-diabetics and Type 2 diabetics. Supplemented by the AIA Vitality Programme, AIA Diabetes Care encourages its members to be proactive about adopting lifestyle choice that will lead to healthier outcomes. These include picking up healthy eating habits, keeping an active lifestyle and going for regular health screening. #dollarsandsense #aiavitality #diabetes #dnssingapore	dnssingapore	2017-09-26 13:29:34+00:00	0	13	http://instagram.com/p/BZfhaxcHW_l/	dnssingapore	20170926T1329
68	Being a bankrupt in Singapore carries an unfortunate stigma in society.

71	The second you pay for your 4D bet, you’ve already lost money, here’s why. The payouts are simply not attractive enough. For every $1 you wager on 4D, you will lose $0.42 on a Small bet, and $0.341 on a Big bet. So how much more would you have if you invested instead of gambled in 4D in the last 10 years? Let’s assume you bet $5, in equal proportion for Small and Big bets for all three 4D draws in a week for the past 10 years, you would have gambled $7,800, and on average, received $4,832.10 from your bets. If you have invested the money in a safe investment such as the STI ETF, you would have been able to achieve close to double of your investment based on its past 10 years of records. (Bearing in mind that you would not have put in a lump sum at the beginning and to ride out the volatility of the markets). Someone always wins when you buy 4D.

76	We're grateful for the calm weather in Hong Kong today. Just a few days ago, the situation was very different. The deadly Typhoon Hato hit Hong Kong and Macau, 12 people were killed, more than 26,000 people were evacuated to temporary shelters and 450 flights were cancelled. Natural disasters bring with them much devastations to a country. On top of the loss of innocent lives and costly infrastructure damage, countries are also affected by disruptions to businesses and public services, including the closure of the Hong Kong stock exchange, numerous factories and countless offices. Share with us your thoughts on how you think natural disasters can affect a country's economy in other ways.	dnssingapore	2017-08-30 14:30:07+00:00	0	24	http://instagram.com/p/BYaG4lBBhYH/	dnssingapore	20170830T1430
77	After my studies, I was fortunate to land my dream job at Double Negative. Started off in a junior position as a Matchmove artist, and worked my way up to a Matchmove Lead over the 3.5 years.

203	Economics of Healthcare: Singapore ranks 2nd in Asia with the high 'out-of-pocket' spending vs other channels such as Government-financed healthcare, Social health and private health insurances. Major trends leading to the increasing healthcare spending includes ageing population of higher medical costs, wealthier societies encourage wealthier people to spend more on health and medical, rising government health expenditure burden, health cost inflation (by advances in medicine) and growing perception of insurance needs.	dnssingapore	2016-06-10 09:52:38+00:00	0	26	http://instagram.com/p/BGdMl_1o0hK/	dnssingapore	20160610T0952

221	When we add the renovation cost to the interest cost, what we get is the actual amount that we spent on our home. The total basic cost adds up to $552,000, excluding any maintenance cost incurred. So a person selling their home for $600,000 should not feel too excited.	dnssingapore	2016-05-18 20:34:08+00:00	1	38	http://instagram.com/p/BFjHuXOI0rw/	dnssingapore	20160518T2034

223	It is normal to judge the cost of a home simply by looking at its selling price. People asked each other about that all the time. “How much did you pay for your home?” However, the true cost of owning a home is a lot more than just its selling price. And if you are a potential buyer of your first home, we like to elaborate more on this so that you are not at the receiving end of a rude shock in the future.	dnssingapore	2016-05-18 20:31:22+00:00	2	41	http://instagram.com/p/BFjHaJjI0rP/	dnssingapore	20160518T2031

43	Can’t deny that CPF is great, but CPF does have its negative downsides as well. It’s a well known fact that Singapore birth rate has declined significantly over the years, hence the number of people to replace the current working class has decreased. With decreasing working class, number of people being subjected to CPF decreases as well. Hence, eventually CPF will (a) run out of money (b) increase the contribution percentage. Singapore is trying its best to gather more people by allow foreigners to migrate over in hopes that it will convince them to stay and be subjected to CPF and taxes. But has it been that case? Most people who takes up citizenship eventually returns to their country, hence further complicating the CPF and tax situation. Another issue is that millennials are taking up more freelance jobs, which are not required to contribute to CPF (grab food, grab driver, designers, event coordinators, etc) this also contributes to the issue of decrease in money within CPF. The only way around that specific issue is (a) government enforces everyone to contribute (b) continue to struggle finding funds for CPF. All these are pointers should be pointed out about CPF before completely trusting CPF. While, I highly doubt that funds within CPF will ever run out but it’s to our best interest to keep in mind that many things are going to change drastically in the years to come.	clockwerkangels	2019-09-21 12:16:44+00:00	5	423	http://instagram.com/p/B2qNZtvl7Qy/	thewokesalaryman	20190921T1216

89	The intent of this piece and artwork are great. But this applies to only a minority. Truth is, many people have no choice but to work long hours from civil servants to taxi drivers to cleaners. Its just the way our society is. So we cant simply say we can work less and therefore we have time for family.

163	The saddest thing is many young couples may want to save money and have more intimate events, but they get guilted and pressured by parents into organising bigger, grander, noisier but ultimately hollower weddings. All so the parents can show off to compete with their other relatives or friends. Hope more go down the route of what you described, a lot of these so-called tradition must haves are pointless and take up a lot of money we don't have.	whimkimm	2019-08-26 18:50:12+00:00	56	1,479	http://instagram.com/p/B1n9ww7l9SL/	thewokesalaryman	20190826T1850

255	I also believe in this strongly. I would rather rely on myself to make my own fortune than rely on parents. That said, the mindset that the wealthy have about money is the one that helps them to make more money and having the right connections helps. A lot. So having wealthy parents who can help you to make even more money helps tremendously. Due to poverty, my parents tend to spend all whatever they have some money (strike 4D, for example) and have no proper financial planning and management. When my father got hospitalised that's when everything gone to shit. I'm glad that tough period is over and I've learnt and grew up a lot from it.	arielnyanko	2019-08-09 21:28:22+00:00	58	1,662	http://instagram.com/p/B08eWSVFE0x/	thewokesalaryman	20190809T2128

334	I remember a Jeopardy final a few years ago that asked to name the invention Susan B. Anthony thought did more for women’s liberation than anything else. The answer (question): What is a bicycle? I’d never heard the quote before, but “bicycle” was the immediate and only thing that popped in my mind during the final Jeopardy music. It was all that to me on a personal level. I used to have dream cars (VW Bug, then VW Thing, then a hearse), but once I got a road bike, the world cracked open and I still see no need for a car. Trucks and things that haul shit, sure, but a car? No.	yndawycih	2019-07-27 08:02:30+00:00	47	963	http://instagram.com/p/B0ZjyrbFE8n/	thewokesalaryman	20190727T0802

341	Forcing a profession to your children is not cool, but I think it's important to teach them that career choice would have HUGE impact on how their life shapes up. In ideal world they can be whatever they want to, but this isn't an ideal world and there are some careers that simply more lucrative, more needed, or more fulfilling than others. By teaching them this you can help them to be more responsible in making the choice and in owning the consequences of that choice. I for one rue that my parents didn't tell me this	ihsanhrd	2019-07-20 22:49:11+00:00	63	2,354	http://instagram.com/p/B0JHsvVFIkO/	thewokesalaryman	20190720T2249

5	I would wait abit more for the price of REITs to subside. 😃 Just my opinion...	finance.nutshell	2019-08-06 19:56:48+00:00	2	33	http://instagram.com/p/B00lfBlFvof/	seedlysg	20190806T1956
6	The single most important lesson I have learnt in investing is diversifying over time. Most people know to diversify their assets. But not many understand the power of diversifying across various time periods. Hence, if I were to invest $40k, I would invest $1000 monthly over the span of 40 months. When the market goes lower, I would buy the ETF more - whether STI or REITs. Retail investors who do not have time to monitor each REIT counter should simply buy the REITs ETF	onceamillenium	2019-08-06 19:56:48+00:00	2	33	http://instagram.com/p/B00lfBlFvof/	seedlysg	20190806T1956

103	I suggest that before one begins investing, one must first understand the limitations of investing. Only by understanding that would you be able to avoid silly and costly mistakes. This starts from an accurate understanding of how the stock market works. This is not a get rich scheme overnight, but it takes years to build up. S&P 500 index has returned 8% annually and you probably aren’t going to achieved better returns than that for most retail investors. Hence, always buy the index first.

331	I have been to Moscow and I’m pretty sure the latte doesn’t cost that much. In fact I did a quick Google search and it’s actually S$5ish. I did note where you get the information that Russia might have the most expensive Starbucks coffee price in the world though. It is adjusted to US spending power. Russia’s average wage is about S$1,600 a month and 5/1600 in % correlates to US$12.32/average American wage. Perhaps you might want to better explain this because it may be confusing and discouraging to people who want to visit Russia and I know some Russians who might be offended by this information that’s not completely representative of the truth.	thisisdoneonimpulse	2019-05-30 18:10:00+00:00	10	98	http://instagram.com/p/ByFTNY3ll4l/	seedlysg	20190530T1810
